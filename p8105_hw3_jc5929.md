**Question 1**

``` r
data("instacart")

instacart = 
  instacart %>% 
  as_tibble(instacart)
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns, with each row
resprenting a single product from an instacart order. Variables include
identifiers for user, order, and product; the order in which each
product was added to the cart. There are several order-level variables,
describing the day and time of the order, and number of days since prior
order. Then there are several item-specific variables, describing the
product name (e.g. Yogurt, Avocado), department (e.g. dairy and eggs,
produce), and aisle (e.g. yogurt, fresh fruits), and whether the item
has been ordered by this user in the past. In total, there are 39123
products found in 131209 orders from 131209 distinct users

A table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and
Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week. This table has
been formatted in an untidy manner for human readers. Pink Lady Apples
are generally purchased slightly earlier in the day than Coffee Ice
Cream, with the exception of day 5.

``` r

The plot shows that the activity count is lowest during sleeping hours,

in the afternoon, from around 8pm to 10pm, especially on Fridays and
Saturdays.

**Question 3**

``` r
data("ny_noaa")
```

The ny_noaa data set contains 2595176 rows and 7 columns. Some key
varibales inlcudes:

`id`: weather station id

`prcp`: Precipitation (tenths of mm)

`snow`: snowfall(mm)

`snwd`: snow depth (mm)

`tmax`: maximum temperature (tenths of degrees C)

`tmin`: minimum temperature (tenths of degrees C)

All variables were converted into standard units. `prcp`, was measured
in tenths of mm, and was converted into mm.

The belows shows infromation of the missing values of the data set.

``` r
 missing_noaa=ny_noaa %>%
  summarize(missing_prcp=sum(is.na(prcp)),
            missing_snow=sum(is.na(snow)),
            missing_snwd=sum(is.na(snwd)),
            missing_tmax=sum(is.na(tmax)),
            missing_tmin=sum(is.na(tmin))
            ) %>%
  knitr::kable()
missing_noaa
```

| missing_prcp | missing_snow | missing_snwd | missing_tmax | missing_tmin |
|-------------:|-------------:|-------------:|-------------:|-------------:|
|       145838 |       381221 |       591786 |      1134358 |      1134420 |

From the table, it is observed that there is quite a lot of missing data
for `tamx` and `tmin`. tmax has about 44% of missing values, and missing
values for tmin accounts approximately for 44%. `snow` and `snwd` has
relatively smaller proportion of missing values. If the data set has a
large amount of missing values, it will casue bias, and could influence
the accuracy for analysis.

``` r
ny_data= ny_noaa %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(date=as.character(date)) %>%
  separate(date,into=c('year','month','date'),sep='-') %>%
  mutate(tmax=as.numeric(tmax),
         tmin=as.numeric(tmin),
         year=as.factor(year),
         date=as.numeric(date),
         month=as.numeric(month), 
         prcp=prcp/10,
         tmax=tmax/10,
         tmin=tmin/10
         )

ny_data %>% 
  count(snow) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 282 × 2
    ##     snow       n

    ##  9    38    9197
    ## 10     3    8790
    ## # … with 272 more rows

All variables were converted into standard units. `prcp`, was measured
in tenths of mm, and was converted into mm. From the data set, it is
seen that the most commonly observed value for snowfall is 0, which
means that most days in nyc, it is not snowing. Since snowy days only
occur in some winter days.

``` r
  ny_data %>%
  filter(month==01|month==07) %>%
  drop_na(tmax) %>%
  group_by(year,id,month) %>%
  summarize(tmax_average=mean(tmax)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year,y=tmax_average,color=month)) + geom_point(alpha=0.3) +
  facet_grid(. ~ month)+labs(
    title = "Avg Max Temp in January and July in each NY Station Across Years",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Temp (°C)")+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year', 'id'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

![](p8105_hw3_jc5929_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->
The average max temperature in January is within -10 to 10°C. The lowest
turns out to be about -13.5°C. There is no significant outliers in
January.

Average max temperature in July appears to be 25-30°C. There is one
outlier where the max temoerature is about 14°C.

Comparing January and JUly, the average max temperature is lower than in
July. It also appear to to fluctuate more in January, as the range in
Junuary is more taller than in July.

The left hand side plot shows `tmax` vs `tmin` for the data set. This
plot shows that most days have a max temperature of 25°C and a min
temperature of 15°C.

The plot on the right shows the distribution of snowfall values greater
than 0 and less than 100 separately by year. From the plot, we can see
that there are multiple peaks, thus it has a multimodal distrbition.
